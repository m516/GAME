\doxysubsubsection*{Support for multiple languages}

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_doxygen}{Doxygen}} has built-\/in support for multiple languages. This means that the text fragments, generated by doxygen, can be produced in languages other than English (the default). The output language is chosen through the configuration option \mbox{\hyperlink{config_cfg_output_language}{O\+U\+T\+P\+U\+T\+\_\+\+L\+A\+N\+G\+U\+A\+GE}} in the configuration file (with default name and known as Doxyfile). To switch between languages inside a comment block the \textbackslash{}$\sim$ command can be used.

Currently (version 1.\+8.\+17), 40 languages are supported (sorted alphabetically)\+: Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Brazilian Portuguese, Catalan, Chinese, Chinese Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese (+En), Korean (+En), Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Serbian\+Cyrillic, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese..

The table of information related to the supported languages follows. It is sorted by language alphabetically. The {\bfseries{Status}} column was generated from sources and shows approximately the last version when the translator was updated.

\doxysubsubsection*{Adding a new language to doxygen}

This short H\+O\+W\+TO explains how to add support for the new language to doxygen\+:

Just follow the following steps\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Tell me for which language you want to add support. If no one else is already working on support for that language, you will be assigned as the maintainer for the language. 
\item Create a copy of {\ttfamily doxygen/src/translator\+\_\+en.\+h} and name it {\ttfamily doxygen/src/translator\+\_\+$<$your\+\_\+2\+\_\+letter\+\_\+country\+\_\+code$>$.h} I\textquotesingle{}ll use {\ttfamily xx} in the rest of this document (and {\ttfamily XX} for the uppercase version). 
\item Edit {\ttfamily doxygen/src/language.\+cpp}\+: Add the following code\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}#ifdef LANG_XX
#include<translator_xx.h>
#endif
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Remember to use the same symbol {\ttfamily L\+A\+N\+G\+\_\+\+XX} that was added to {\ttfamily doxygen/src/lang\+\_\+cfg.\+h}. 

Now, in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{language_8cpp_a78f42921749f1c170d711f41e4d58cc9}{set\+Translator()}}} add \begin{DoxyVerb}#ifdef LANG_XX
    else if (L_EQUAL("your_language_name"))
    {
      theTranslator = new TranslatorYourLanguage;
    }
#endif
\end{DoxyVerb}
 after the {\ttfamily if \{ ... \}}. I.\+e., it must be placed after the code for creating the English translator at the beginning, and before the {\ttfamily else \{ ... \}} part that creates the translator for the default language (English again). 
\item Edit {\ttfamily doxygen/src/translator\+\_\+xx.\+h}\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use the U\+T\+F-\/8 capable editor and open the file using the U\+T\+F-\/8 mode. 
\item Rename {\ttfamily T\+R\+A\+N\+S\+L\+A\+T\+O\+R\+\_\+\+E\+N\+\_\+H} to {\ttfamily T\+R\+A\+N\+S\+L\+A\+T\+O\+R\+\_\+\+X\+X\+\_\+H} twice (i.\+e. in the {\ttfamily \#ifndef} and {\ttfamily \#define} preprocessor commands at the beginning of the file). 
\item Rename {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator_english}{Translator\+English}}} to {\ttfamily Translator\+Your\+Language} 
\item In the member {\ttfamily id\+Language()} change \char`\"{}english\char`\"{} into the name of your language (use lower case characters only). Depending on the language you may also wish to change the member functions {\ttfamily latex\+Language\+Support\+Command()} and other (you will recognize them when you start the work). 
\item Edit all the strings that are returned by the member functions that start with {\ttfamily tr}. Try to match punctuation and capitals! To enter special characters (with accents) you can\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Enter them directly if your keyboard supports that. Recall that the text is expected to be saved using the U\+T\+F-\/8 encoding. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_doxygen}{Doxygen}} will translate the characters to proper \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX and leaves the H\+T\+ML and man output in U\+T\+F-\/8. 
\item Use H\+T\+ML codes like {\ttfamily \&auml}; for an {\ttfamily a} with an {\ttfamily umlaut} (i.\+e. {\ttfamily \"{a}}). See the H\+T\+ML specification for the codes. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item On $\ast$nix systems\+:~\newline
 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rerun the {\ttfamily configure} script from the root (i.\+e. in the {\ttfamily doxygen} directory) so that it generates {\ttfamily doxygen/src/lang\+\_\+cfg.\+h}. This file should now contain a {\ttfamily \#define} for your language code.~\newline
 
\item Run {\ttfamily make} again from the root (i.\+e. in the {\ttfamily doxygen} directory) of the distribution, in order to regenerate the {\ttfamily Makefile}s. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item On Windows\+:~\newline
 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item stop Visual Stdio~\newline
 
\item open a command window~\newline
 
\item goto the directory {\ttfamily doxygen\textbackslash{}src}~\newline
 
\item give the command {\ttfamily python \mbox{\hyperlink{languages_8py}{languages.\+py}} $>$ ..\textbackslash{}winbuild\textbackslash{}Languages.\+rules}~\newline
 
\item close the command window~\newline
 
\item start Visual Studio again~\newline
 
\item Your language should now be selectable in the {\ttfamily General} part of the {\ttfamily Settings} of the {\ttfamily Properties} window of {\ttfamily lang\+\_\+cfg.\+py}, by default Your language will be {\ttfamily on}. Rebuild {\ttfamily doxygen} (and {\ttfamily doxywizard}) now. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Now you can use {\ttfamily O\+U\+T\+P\+U\+T\+\_\+\+L\+A\+N\+G\+U\+A\+GE = your\+\_\+language\+\_\+name} in the config file to generate output in your language. 
\item Send {\ttfamily translator\+\_\+xx.\+h} to me so I can add it to doxygen. Send also your name and e-\/mail address to be included in the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{maintainers_8txt}{maintainers.\+txt}}} list. You can also clone the doxygen repository at Git\+Hub and make a Pull Request later. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\doxysubsubsection*{Maintaining a language}

New versions of doxygen may use new translated sentences. In such situation, the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}}} class requires implementation of new methods -- its interface changes. Of course, the English sentences need to be translated to the other languages. At least, new methods have to be implemented by the language-\/related translator class; otherwise, doxygen wouldn\textquotesingle{}t even compile. Waiting until all language maintainers have translated the new sentences and sent the results would not be very practical. The following text describes the usage of translator adapters to solve the problem.

{\bfseries{The role of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}} Adapters.}} Whenever the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}}} class interface changes in the new release, the new class {\ttfamily Translator\+Adapter\+\_\+x\+\_\+y\+\_\+z} is added to the {\ttfamily translator\+\_\+adapter.\+h} file (here x, y, and z are numbers that correspond to the current official version of doxygen). All translators that previously derived from the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}}} class now derive from this adapter class.

The {\ttfamily Translator\+Adapter\+\_\+x\+\_\+y\+\_\+z} class implements the new, required methods. If the new method replaces some similar but obsolete method(s) (e.\+g. if the number of arguments changed and/or the functionality of the older method was changed or enriched), the {\ttfamily Translator\+Adapter\+\_\+x\+\_\+y\+\_\+z} class may use the obsolete method to get the result which is as close as possible to the older result in the target language. If it is not possible, the result (the default translation) is obtained using the English translator, which is (by definition) always up-\/to-\/date.

{\bfseries{For example,}} when the new {\ttfamily tr\+File()} method with parameters (to determine the capitalization of the first letter and the singular/plural form) was introduced to replace the older method {\ttfamily tr\+Files()} without arguments, the following code appeared in one of the translator adapter classes\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}    /*! This is the default implementation of the obsolete method
     * used in the documentation of a group before the list of
     * links to documented files.  This is possibly localized.
     */
    virtual QCString trFiles()
    { return "Files"; }

    /*! This is the localized implementation of newer equivalent
     * using the obsolete method trFiles().
     */
    virtual QCString trFile(bool first_capital, bool singular)
    {
      if (first_capital && !singular)
        return trFiles();  // possibly localized, obsolete method
      else
        return english.trFile(first_capital, singular);
    }
\end{DoxyVerb}


The {\ttfamily tr\+Files()} is not present in the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator_english}{Translator\+English}}} class, because it was removed as obsolete. However, it was used until now and its call was replaced by

\begin{DoxyVerb}    trFile(true, false)
\end{DoxyVerb}


in the doxygen source files. Probably, many language translators implemented the obsolete method, so it perfectly makes sense to use the same language dependent result in those cases. The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator_english}{Translator\+English}}} does not implement the old method. It derives from the abstract {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}}} class. On the other hand, the old translator for a different language does not implement the new {\ttfamily tr\+File()} method. Because of that it is derived from another base class -- {\ttfamily Translator\+Adapter\+\_\+x\+\_\+y\+\_\+z}. The {\ttfamily Translator\+Adapter\+\_\+x\+\_\+y\+\_\+z} class has to implement the new, required {\ttfamily tr\+File()} method. However, the translator adapter would not be compiled if the {\ttfamily tr\+Files()} method was not implemented. This is the reason for implementing the old method in the translator adapter class (using the same code, that was removed from the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator_english}{Translator\+English}}).

The simplest way would be to pass the arguments to the English translator and to return its result. Instead, the adapter uses the old {\ttfamily tr\+Files()} in one special case -- when the new {\ttfamily tr\+File(true,~false)} is called. This is the mostly used case at the time of introducing the new method -- see above. While this may look too complicated, the technique allows the developers of the core sources to change the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}} interface, while the users may not even notice the change. Of course, when the new {\ttfamily tr\+File()} is used with different arguments, the English result is returned and it will be noticed by non English users. Here the maintainer of the language translator should implement at least that one particular method.

{\bfseries{What says the base class of a language translator?}} If the language translator class inherits from any adapter class then maintenance is needed. In such case, the language translator is considered not up-\/to-\/date. On the other hand, if the language translator derives directly from the abstract class {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}}}, the language translator is up-\/to-\/date.

The translator adapter classes are chained so that the older translator adapter class uses the one-\/step-\/newer translator adapter as the base class. The newer adapter does less {\itshape adapting} work than the older one. The oldest adapter class derives (indirectly) from all of the adapter classes. The name of the adapter class is chosen so that its suffix is derived from the previous official version of doxygen that did not need the adapter. This way, one can say approximately, when the language translator class was last updated -- see details below.

The newest translator adapter derives from the abstract {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator_adapter_base}{Translator\+Adapter\+Base}}} class that derives directly from the abstract {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}}} class. It adds only the private English-\/translator member for easy implementation of the default translation inside the adapter classes, and it also enforces implementation of one method for notifying the user that the language translation is not up-\/to-\/date (because of that some sentences in the generated files may appear in English).

Once the oldest adapter class is not used by any of the language translators, it can be removed from the doxygen project. The maintainers should try to reach the state with the minimal number of translator adapter classes.

{\bfseries{To simplify the maintenance of the language translator classes}} for the supported languages, the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{translator_8py}{translator.\+py}}} Python script was developed (located in {\ttfamily doxygen/doc} directory). It extracts the important information about obsolete and new methods from the source files for each of the languages. The information is stored in the translator report A\+S\+C\+II file ({\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{translator__report_8txt}{translator\+\_\+report.\+txt}}}).



Looking at the base class of the language translator, the script guesses also the status of the translator -- see the last column of the table with languages above. The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{translator_8py}{translator.\+py}}} is called automatically when the doxygen documentation is generated. You can also run the script manually whenever you feel that it can help you. Of course, you are not forced to use the results of the script. You can find the same information by looking at the adapter class and its base classes.

{\bfseries{How should I update my language translator?}} First, you should be the language maintainer, or you should let him/her know about the changes. The following text was written for the language maintainers as the primary audience.

There are several approaches to be taken when updating your language. If you are not extremely busy, you should always chose the most radical one. When the update takes much more time than you expected, you can always decide use some suitable translator adapter to finish the changes later and still make your translator working.

{\bfseries{The most radical way of updating the language translator}} is to make your translator class derive directly from the abstract class {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}}} and provide translations for the methods that are required to be implemented -- the compiler will tell you if you forgot to implement some of them. If you are in doubt, have a look at the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator_english}{Translator\+English}}} class to recognize the purpose of the implemented method. Looking at the previously used adapter class may help you sometimes, but it can also be misleading because the adapter classes do implement also the obsolete methods (see the previous {\ttfamily tr\+Files()} example).

In other words, the up-\/to-\/date language translators do not need the {\ttfamily Translator\+Adapter\+\_\+x\+\_\+y\+\_\+z} classes at all, and you do not need to implement anything else than the methods required by the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}} class (i.\+e. the pure virtual methods of the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}}} -- they end with {\ttfamily =0;}).

If everything compiles fine, try to run {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{translator_8py}{translator.\+py}}}, and have a look at the translator report (A\+S\+C\+II file) at the {\ttfamily doxygen/doc} directory. Your translator is marked as up-\/to-\/date only if the script does not detect anything special. If the translator uses the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}}} base class, there still may be some remarks related to your source code. In the case, the translator is marked as {\itshape almost up-\/to-\/date}. Namely, the obsolete methods--that are not used at all--may be listed in the section for your language. Simply, remove their code (and run the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{translator_8py}{translator.\+py}}} again). Also, you will be informed when you forgot to change the base class of your translator class to some newer adapter class or directly to the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator}{Translator}} class.

{\bfseries{If you do not have time to finish all the updates}} you should still start with {\itshape the most radical approach} as described above. You can always change the base class to the translator adapter class that implements all of the not-\/yet-\/implemented methods.

{\bfseries{If you prefer to update your translator gradually}}, have a look at {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator_english}{Translator\+English}}} (the {\ttfamily translator\+\_\+en.\+h} file). Inside, you will find the comments like {\ttfamily new since 1.\+2.\+4} that separate always a number of methods that were implemented in the stated version. Do implement the group of methods that are placed below the comment that uses the same version numbers as your translator adapter class. (For example, your translator class have to use the {\ttfamily Translator\+Adapter\+\_\+1\+\_\+2\+\_\+4}, if it does not implement the methods below the comment {\ttfamily new since 1.\+2.\+4}. When you implement them, your class should use a newer translator adapter.

Run the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{translator_8py}{translator.\+py}}} script occasionally and give it your {\ttfamily xx} identification (from {\ttfamily translator\+\_\+xx.\+h}) to create the translator report shorter (also produced faster) -- it will contain only the information related to your translator. Once you reach the state when the base class should be changed to some newer adapter, you will see the note in the translator report.

Warning\+: Don\textquotesingle{}t forget to compile doxygen to discover, whether it is compilable. The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{translator_8py}{translator.\+py}}} does not check if everything is correct with respect to the compiler. Because of that, it may lie sometimes about the necessary base class.

{\bfseries{The most obsolete language translators}} would lead to implementation of too complicated adapters. Because of that, doxygen developers may decide to derive such translators from the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_translator_english}{Translator\+English}}} class, which is by definition always up-\/to-\/date.

When doing so, all the missing methods will be replaced by the English translation. This means that not-\/implemented methods will always return the English result. Such translators are marked using the word {\ttfamily obsolete}. You should read it {\bfseries{really obsolete}}. No guess about the last update can be done.

Often, it is possible to construct better result from the obsolete methods. Because of that, the translator adapter classes should be used if possible. On the other hand, implementation of adapters for really obsolete translators brings too much maintenance and run-\/time overhead.
