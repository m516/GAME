Since version 1.\+2.\+18, doxygen can generate a new output format we have called the "Perl Module output format". It has been designed as an intermediate format that can be used to generate new and customized output without having to modify the doxygen source. Therefore, its purpose is similar to the X\+ML output format that can be also generated by doxygen. The X\+ML output format is more standard, but the Perl Module output format is possibly simpler and easier to use.

The Perl Module output format is still experimental at the moment and could be changed in incompatible ways in future versions, although this should not be very probable. It is also lacking some features of other doxygen backends. However, it can be already used to generate useful output, as shown by the Perl Module-\/based \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX generator.

Please report any bugs or problems you find in the Perl Module backend or the Perl Module-\/based \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX generator to the doxygen-\/develop mailing list. Suggestions are welcome as well.\hypertarget{perlmod_using_perlmod_fmt}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{perlmod_using_perlmod_fmt}
When the \mbox{\hyperlink{config_cfg_generate_perlmod}{G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+P\+E\+R\+L\+M\+OD}} tag is enabled in the Doxyfile, running doxygen generates a number of files in the {\ttfamily perlmod/} subdirectory of your output directory. These files are the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Doxy\+Docs.\+pm}\+: This is the Perl module that actually contains the documentation, in the Perl Module format described \mbox{\hyperlink{perlmod_doxydocs_format}{below}}.


\item {\ttfamily Doxy\+Model.\+pm}\+: This Perl module describes the structure of {\ttfamily Doxy\+Docs.\+pm}, independently of the actual documentation. See \mbox{\hyperlink{perlmod_doxymodel_format}{below}} for details.


\item {\ttfamily doxyrules.\+make}\+: This file contains the make rules to build and clean the files that are generated from the Doxyfile. Also contains the paths to those files and other relevant information. This file is intended to be included by your own Makefile.


\item {\ttfamily Makefile}\+: This is a simple Makefile including {\ttfamily doxyrules.\+make}.


\end{DoxyItemize}

To make use of the documentation stored in Doxy\+Docs.\+pm you can use one of the default Perl Module-\/based generators provided by doxygen (at the moment this includes the Perl Module-\/based \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX generator, see \mbox{\hyperlink{perlmod_perlmod_latex}{below}}) or write your own customized generator. This should not be too hard if you have some knowledge of Perl and it\textquotesingle{}s the main purpose of including the Perl Module backend in doxygen. See \mbox{\hyperlink{perlmod_doxydocs_format}{below}} for details on how to do this.\hypertarget{perlmod_perlmod_latex}{}\doxysection{Using the La\+Te\+X generator.}\label{perlmod_perlmod_latex}
The Perl Module-\/based \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX generator is pretty experimental and incomplete at the moment, but you could find it useful nevertheless. It can generate documentation for functions, typedefs and variables within files and classes and can be customized quite a lot by redefining \textbackslash{}\+TeX macros. However, there is still no documentation on how to do this.

Setting the \mbox{\hyperlink{config_cfg_perlmod_latex}{P\+E\+R\+L\+M\+O\+D\+\_\+\+L\+A\+T\+EX}} tag to {\ttfamily Y\+ES} in the {\ttfamily Doxyfile} enables the creation of some additional files in the {\ttfamily perlmod/} subdirectory of your output directory. These files contain the Perl scripts and \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX code necessary to generate P\+DF and D\+VI output from the Perl Module output, using {\ttfamily pdflatex} and {\ttfamily latex} respectively. Rules to automate the use of these files are also added to {\ttfamily doxyrules.\+make} and the {\ttfamily Makefile}.

The additional generated files are the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily doxylatex.\+pl}\+: This Perl script uses {\ttfamily Doxy\+Docs.\+pm} and Doxy\+Model.\+pm to generate {\ttfamily doxydocs.\+tex}, a \textbackslash{}\+TeX file containing the documentation in a format that can be accessed by \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX code. This file is not directly La\+Te\+Xable.


\item {\ttfamily doxyformat.\+tex}\+: This file contains the \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX code that transforms the documentation from doxydocs.\+tex into \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX text suitable to be \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX\textquotesingle{}ed and presented to the user.


\item {\ttfamily doxylatex-\/template.\+pl}\+: This Perl script uses {\ttfamily Doxy\+Model.\+pm} to generate {\ttfamily doxytemplate.\+tex}, a \textbackslash{}\+TeX file defining default values for some macros. doxytemplate.\+tex is included by doxyformat.\+tex to avoid the need of explicitly defining some macros.


\item {\ttfamily doxylatex.\+tex}\+: This is a very simple \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX document that loads some packages and includes doxyformat.\+tex and doxydocs.\+tex. This document is \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX\textquotesingle{}ed to produce the P\+DF and D\+VI documentation by the rules added to {\ttfamily doxyrules.\+make}.


\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{perlmod_pm_pdf_gen}{}\doxysubsection{Creation of P\+D\+F and D\+V\+I output}\label{perlmod_pm_pdf_gen}
To try this you need to have installed {\ttfamily latex}, {\ttfamily pdflatex} and the packages used by {\ttfamily doxylatex.\+tex}.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Update your {\ttfamily Doxyfile} to the latest version using\+:


\begin{DoxyPre}doxygen -\/u Doxyfile\end{DoxyPre}



\item Set both \mbox{\hyperlink{config_cfg_generate_perlmod}{G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+P\+E\+R\+L\+M\+OD}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{config_cfg_perlmod_latex}{P\+E\+R\+L\+M\+O\+D\+\_\+\+L\+A\+T\+EX}} tags to {\ttfamily Y\+ES} in your Doxyfile.


\item Run doxygen on your Doxyfile\+:


\begin{DoxyPre}doxygen Doxyfile\end{DoxyPre}



\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a}{A}} {\ttfamily perlmod/} subdirectory should have appeared in your output directory. Enter the {\ttfamily perlmod/} subdirectory and run\+:


\begin{DoxyPre}make pdf\end{DoxyPre}




This should generate a {\ttfamily doxylatex.\+pdf} with the documentation in P\+DF format.


\item Run\+:


\begin{DoxyPre}make dvi\end{DoxyPre}




This should generate a {\ttfamily doxylatex.\+dvi} with the documentation in D\+VI format.


\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{perlmod_doxydocs_format}{}\doxysection{Documentation format.}\label{perlmod_doxydocs_format}
The Perl Module documentation generated by doxygen is stored in {\ttfamily Doxy\+Docs.\+pm}. This is a very simple Perl module that contains only two statements\+: an assignment to the variable {\ttfamily \$doxydocs} and the customary {\ttfamily 1;} statement which usually ends Perl modules. ~\newline
 The documentation is stored in the variable {\ttfamily \$doxydocs}, which can then be accessed by a Perl script using {\ttfamily Doxy\+Docs.\+pm}.

{\ttfamily \$doxydocs} contains a tree-\/like structure composed of three types of nodes\+: strings, hashes and lists.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Strings}\+: These are normal Perl strings. They can be of any length can contain any character. Their semantics depends on their location within the tree. This type of node has no children.


\item {\ttfamily Hashes}\+: These are references to anonymous Perl hashes. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a}{A}} hash can have multiple fields, each with a different key. The value of a hash field can be a string, a hash or a list, and its semantics depends on the key of the hash field and the location of the hash within the tree. The values of the hash fields are the children of the node.


\item {\ttfamily Lists}\+: These are references to anonymous Perl lists. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a}{A}} list has an undefined number of elements, which are the children of the node. Each element has the same type (string, hash or list) and the same semantics, depending on the location of the list within the tree.


\end{DoxyItemize}

As you can see, the documentation contained in {\ttfamily \$doxydocs} does not present any special impediment to be processed by a simple Perl script. ~\newline
\hypertarget{perlmod_doxymodel_format}{}\doxysection{Data structure}\label{perlmod_doxymodel_format}
You might be interested in processing the documentation contained in {\ttfamily Doxy\+Docs.\+pm} without needing to take into account the semantics of each node of the documentation tree. For this purpose, doxygen generates a {\ttfamily Doxy\+Model.\+pm} file which contains a data structure describing the type and children of each node in the documentation tree.

The rest of this section is to be written yet, but in the meantime you can look at the Perl scripts generated by doxygen (such as {\ttfamily doxylatex.\+pl} or {\ttfamily doxytemplate-\/latex.\+pl}) to get an idea on how to use {\ttfamily Doxy\+Model.\+pm}.
