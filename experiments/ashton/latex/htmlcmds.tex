Here is a list of all H\+T\+ML commands that may be used inside the documentation. Note that although these H\+T\+ML tags are translated to the proper commands for output formats other than H\+T\+ML, all attributes of a H\+T\+ML tag are passed on to the H\+T\+ML output only (the {\ttfamily H\+R\+EF} and {\ttfamily N\+A\+ME} attributes for the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a}{A}}} tag are the only exception).
