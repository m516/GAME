Most documentation systems have special `see also' sections where links to other pieces of documentation can be inserted. Although doxygen also has a command to start such a section (See section \textbackslash{}sa), it does allow you to put these kind of links anywhere in the documentation. For \textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX documentation a reference to the page number is written instead of a link. Furthermore, the index at the end of the document can be used to quickly find the documentation of a member, class, namespace or file. For man pages no reference information is generated.

The next sections show how to generate links to the various documented entities in a source file.\hypertarget{autolink_linkurl}{}\doxysection{Links to web pages and mail addresses}\label{autolink_linkurl}
\mbox{\hyperlink{class_doxygen}{Doxygen}} will automatically replace any U\+R\+Ls and mail addresses found in the documentation by links (in H\+T\+ML). To manually specify link text, use the H\+T\+ML \textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily a}\textquotesingle{} tag\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<a href="linkURL">link text</a> \end{DoxyVerb}
 which will be automatically translated to other output formats by doxygen.\hypertarget{autolink_linkclass}{}\doxysection{Links to classes}\label{autolink_linkclass}
All words in the documentation that correspond to a documented class and contain at least one non-\/lower case character will automatically be replaced by a link to the page containing the documentation of the class. If you want to prevent that a word that corresponds to a documented class is replaced by a link you should put a \% in front of the word. To link to an all lower case symbol, use \textbackslash{}ref.\hypertarget{autolink_linkfile}{}\doxysection{Links to files}\label{autolink_linkfile}
All words that contain a dot ({\ttfamily .}) that is not the last character in the word are considered to be file names. If the word is indeed the name of a documented input file, a link will automatically be created to the documentation of that file.\hypertarget{autolink_linkfunc}{}\doxysection{Links to functions}\label{autolink_linkfunc}
Links to functions are created if one of the following patterns is encountered\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily $<$function\+Name$>$\char`\"{}(\char`\"{}$<$argument-\/list$>$\char`\"{})\char`\"{}} 
\item {\ttfamily $<$function\+Name$>$\char`\"{}()\char`\"{}} 
\item {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+::\char`\"{}$<$function\+Name$>$} 
\item {\ttfamily ($<$class\+Name$>$\char`\"{}\+::\char`\"{})\textsuperscript{n}$<$function\+Name$>$\char`\"{}(\char`\"{}$<$argument-\/list$>$\char`\"{})\char`\"{}} 
\item {\ttfamily ($<$class\+Name$>$\char`\"{}\+::\char`\"{})\textsuperscript{n}$<$function\+Name$>$\char`\"{}(\char`\"{}$<$argument-\/list$>$\char`\"{})\char`\"{}$<$modifiers$>$} 
\item {\ttfamily ($<$class\+Name$>$\char`\"{}\+::\char`\"{})\textsuperscript{n}$<$function\+Name$>$\char`\"{}()\char`\"{}} 
\item {\ttfamily ($<$class\+Name$>$\char`\"{}\+::\char`\"{})\textsuperscript{n}$<$function\+Name$>$} 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}where n$>$0.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Note 1\+: }
Function arguments should be specified with correct types, i.\+e. \textquotesingle{}fun(const std\+::string\&,bool)\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}()\textquotesingle{} to match any prototype. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Note 2\+:}
Member function modifiers (like \textquotesingle{}const\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}volatile\textquotesingle{}) are required to identify the target, i.\+e. \textquotesingle{}func(int) const\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}\mbox{\hyperlink{070__ref__variadic__template_8cpp_affb6da6cff1b57cdf8efc0123dceac9b}{func(int)}}\textquotesingle{} target different member functions. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Note 3\+: }
For Javadoc compatibility a \# may be used instead of a \+:: in the patterns above. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Note 4\+:}
In the documentation of a class containing a member foo, a reference to a global variable is made using \char`\"{}\+::foo\char`\"{}, whereas \#foo will link to the member.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
For non overloaded members the argument list may be omitted.

If a function is overloaded and no matching argument list is specified (i.\+e. pattern 2 or 6 is used), a link will be created to the documentation of one of the overloaded members.

For member functions the class scope (as used in patterns 4 to 7) may be omitted, if\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The pattern points to a documented member that belongs to the same class as the documentation block that contains the pattern. 
\item The class that corresponds to the documentation blocks that contains the pattern has a base class that contains a documented member that matches the pattern. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{autolink_linkother}{}\doxysection{Links to other members}\label{autolink_linkother}
All of these entities can be linked to in the same way as described in the previous section. For sake of clarity it is advised to only use patterns 3 and 7 in this case.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Example\+:}

\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
   
  See \hyperlink{autolink_example}{Autolink example}
  for the corresponding \mbox{\LaTeX} documentation that is generated by doxygen.
  
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\hypertarget{autolink_resolving}{}\doxysection{typedefs}\label{autolink_resolving}
Typedefs that involve classes, structs and unions, like \begin{DoxyVerb}typedef struct StructName TypeName
\end{DoxyVerb}
 create an alias for Struct\+Name, so links will be generated to Struct\+Name, when either Struct\+Name itself or Type\+Name is encountered.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Example\+:}

\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
   
  See \hyperlink{restypedef_8cpp}{Typedef example}
  for the corresponding \mbox{\LaTeX} documentation that is generated by doxygen.
