 Our main function starts like this\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 First we create an object {\ttfamily t} of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_include___test}{Include\+\_\+\+Test}} class. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 Then we call the example member function 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 After that our little test routine ends. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
